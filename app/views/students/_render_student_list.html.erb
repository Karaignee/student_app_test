_render_student_list.html.erb

Step 1:
Students Controller Action to create a json array of the student list
called render_student_list

Step 2
Route the controller action in a get request, I've currently written this as:
get '/students' => "render_student_list#students"

Step 3
Create a partial (this current file).

Step 4
Create a jQuery file with a .js.erb extension for the partial, and write a statement to trigger the lists rendering.

Step 5
Add a button link into the student index view to trigger the get request to the Student controller, use :remote => true

Within the timeframe, I was not able to complete this part of the test.  To fill in the blanks I will review the rails guides for Ajax, there is an old RailsCast on this, and any other suggestions welcome!
